# 🔺 Looping(Patterns)-Pascal's Triangle Generator in Python

This project demonstrates a simple Python program to generate **Pascal’s Triangle**, where the number of rows is provided by the user.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program that generates **Pascal's Triangle** using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Input the number of rows from the user.
3. Loop from 0 to the number of rows.
4. For each row:
   - Print appropriate spaces to shape the triangle.
   - Compute values using the formula:  
     \[
     C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     \]
5. Print all rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
6. End the program.

## 🧪 Program
```

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):
    num = 1
    for j in range(i + 1):
        print(num, end=" ")
        num = num * (i - j) // (j + 1)
    print()

```

## Result


The program successfully generates **Pascal's Triangle** based on the number of rows entered by the user. Each row is formed using the sum of adjacent numbers from the previous row, creating the characteristic triangular pattern of Pascal's Triangle.
